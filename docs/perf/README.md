# Performance

This directory documents the performance characteristics of the qumo relay and
its underlying MoQ library, gomoqt. The work is a measurement-first performance
engineering cycle: every conclusion is backed by a benchmark or profile, and
optimizations are only adopted when they move a measured metric past the noise
floor.

If you are looking for one number: **a single qumo relay sustains roughly 1000
active audio subscribers (30 fps, 1200 B) within a 300 ms p99 SLO**, and the
limiting factor is the per-subscriber fan-out drain, not CPU, GC, or the relay's
own code. The detail and the evidence are below.

## The headline answers

- **Single relay, active fan-out:** ~1000 subscribers at 30 fps / 1200 B, p99
  ~56 ms, < 2 % loss. A sharp latency knee follows at 1000–1500.
- **What limits it:** the per-frame fan-out drain — one published frame must be
  written to every subscriber's QUIC stream, and the tail grows with subscriber
  count. It is a *service-rate* effect, not lock contention or GC.
- **What does *not* limit it:** relay CPU (the relay never saturates its cores),
  GC (~2 %), relay locks (~0), the ring/cache, gomoqt's encode path, or the
  broadcast/notify primitive itself (0.05 % of CPU).
- **Does scaling help?** Cores plateau at ~4–8 (2→4 is transformative, 8→16 is
  nothing). Hierarchy (hub → K edges) cuts p99 ~7× (227 → 34 ms at 1000 subs)
  by dividing the fan-out, but on one host it multiplies capacity by ~1.5×, not
  K× — every relay shares the same cores. Real horizontal capacity needs a relay
  per host.
- **Is gomoqt the bottleneck?** No. In a pure-gomoqt real-QUIC profile gomoqt's
  own code is ~3–4 % of CPU, its egress path is 0-allocation/0-copy, and its
  internal blocking is effectively zero. The remaining latency is owned by
  quic-go, the Go runtime, and the kernel.

## Reading order

1. [**Baseline**](baseline.md) — the workload definition, the single-relay
   capacity envelope, and the audio SLO knee. Start here.
2. [**Bottleneck attribution**](bottleneck-attribution.md) — where CPU, latency,
   and waiting actually accumulate; the per-stage decomposition; the fan-out
   optimization candidates that were tried and refuted; the gomoqt verdict.
3. [**Scaling**](scaling.md) — subscriber, core, and topology (hierarchy)
   scaling, and why a single host cannot show real horizontal capacity.
4. [**Workload model**](workload-model.md) — why the audio baseline uses one
   frame per group, how that differs from video GOPs, and the publisher pacing
   check.
5. [**Optimization ledger**](optimization-ledger.md) — the running log of every
   optimization attempt, with its measured result and adopt/reject decision.

## Method

The cycle follows a strict discipline: frame the question, capture a baseline
with its variance, profile under a representative workload, pre-register a
falsifiable hypothesis, make one isolated change, measure before/after, and
revert anything that does not move the metric past the noise floor. "No change"
is an acceptable and common outcome. The benchmark harnesses and profiling
commands are documented in each report.
